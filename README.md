# empymod moved to EMSiG

The empymod-organization started as a home for the code `empymod`.
Later it was joined by `emg3d`, and there might be more in the future.
This has caused some confusion, why a new, neutral home was created:
**EMSiG: ElectroMagnetic Simulation in Geophysics**.

The old organization is currently kept, to protect the forwarding links.
However, it will be abandend sometimes in the future.
Please update all your links to reflect the new org name.

This includes the change from [empymod.github.io](https://empymod.github.io) to [emsig.github.io](https://emsig.github.io), including all sub-sites.
